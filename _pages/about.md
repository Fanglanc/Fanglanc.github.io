Fanglan Chen is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Dr. [Chang-Tien Lu](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~clu/). She holds an MS degree in Computer Science and an MURP degree in Urban and Regional Planning, both from Virginia Tech. Her research integrates AI ethics and urban computing, with a focus on advancing deep learning methods—particularly graph neural networks and reinforcement learning—to address interdisciplinary challenges. She has published papers in leading conferences (e.g., ACL, ECCV, KDD, AAAI, and SDM). Her work on automated school redistricting has received media coverage from [AIhub](https://aihub.org/2023/05/02/interview-with-fanglan-chen-exploring-tradeoffs-in-automated-school-redistricting/). She also serves as a program committee member for conferences such as AAAI and PAKDD.
